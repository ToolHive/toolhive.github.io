## 💛 Our Core Values

### 🧠 No AI, You must stay in control
AI won’t stand in front of the authorities when something goes wrong.  
You will.

That’s why ToolHive avoids AI-driven decision-making. You stay in charge of your data, tools, and compliance, with full visibility and clear decisions.

### 🌍 Compliance is for everyone
Legal texts are complicated. From data privacy to NIS2 to ePrivacy, there’s a lot to keep track of.

ToolHive breaks it down:
- Clear sections
- Simple language
- Visual overviews
- No legal degree required

We believe understanding your obligations should be a feature, not a frustration.
